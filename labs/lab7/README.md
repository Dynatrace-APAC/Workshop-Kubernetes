# Process Detection for Canary Deployment

### 1. Deploy the Canary Release 

```bash
 ./deploy-canary.sh
```

Execute <b>kubectl get pods -n production -o wide</b> and you will see you now have both <b>stable and canary releases running for the front-end service</b>

Wait 1-2 minutes then look the Services in Dynatrace. You have 2 services in production, one for stable and one for canary release.
For monitoring purposes, it should be the same service

### 2. Process Detection Rule Config

In the Dynatrace console, go in Settings -> Processes and containers -> Process group detection.

Expand the Process detection rules section. 

Click <b>Add detection</b> rule.

Select Use a process property

We want to apply this rule for pods running in production only (namespace=production)

Also, extract the identifier after the "." in the pod name. 
Remember the pod names have ".stable "or ".canary" in their name to distinguish them

Recycle both stable and canary frontend pods. The process detection rules are applied on process startup.

<b>./recycle-sockshop-frontend.sh </b>

Make sure the pods are ready 

<b>kubectl get deployments -n production -l tier=frontend</b>

Within Dynatrace, you can see that the Process Groups have been merged.

The services are still detected as individual services and can be merged as well.

Settings -> Merge Service monitoring -> Create merged service

### 3. Validate

With the services merged as one, you can now apply Stable vs Canary Multi-dimensional analysis views based on splittings
